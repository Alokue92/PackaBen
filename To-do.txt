Currently it's not necessary to have a PackaBenPy. We'll use rpy2 to run functions out of R until it becomes prohibatively slow, and then we'll add functions into PackaBenPy to overcome slow speeds. 

PackaBen should include the following functions:

ReloadSIA() 
WorkingHistogram()
	and associated functions()
TreatHDAsSQL()
CreateFog()?
Speed()
	This will eventually encapsulate
		Binning
		Multicoring
			For and dplyr style
		Daemon access


-----------------------


Implement is_sql_compatible()

Possibly attempt a “dry run” with a small in-memory or mock DB, see if dbplyr can translate the pipeline.
Or parse the function body for known verbs (filter, mutate, arrange, etc.) and bail if we see unknown R calls.
Implement or refine apply_pipeline_sql()

Actually call pipeline_func(lazy_tbl) and ensure it stays lazy. Possibly you’d do:
r
Copy
Edit
result <- pipeline_func(lazy_tbl)
# check class of result -> still a lazy object?
# if not, user might have forced collect()
Implement create_sql_from_file()

For CSV ingestion in DuckDB (like dbExecute(con, "CREATE TABLE x AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(...)")).
If you have different file formats (Parquet, etc.), handle accordingly.
Implement chunk_based_read_csv_and_process()

Possibly use readr::read_csv_chunked() or manually read partial rows in a loop.
Or vroom::vroom with indexing. Then do parallel transforms and combine.
Implement chunk_based_in_memory()

The logic from your earlier skeleton for chunking a data frame in memory, writing each chunk to disk, parallelizing, reassembling, etc.
If you want partial aggregator logic for global grouping, you’ll do two-pass. Right now, we do a stub.
Edge Cases

If the user’s pipeline does partial advanced R code plus a global arrange(), you might want to fallback to an error or a custom message.
If the user is on a system that doesn’t have wmic (e.g., Mac/Linux), your resource detection might differ.
If the file format is not CSV, handle that separately.
Testing & Error Handling

Try small data, large data, different pipeline complexities, etc. to ensure it doesn’t break unexpectedly.
